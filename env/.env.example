# Encryption secrets
#
# The following key value pairs are only necessary in 2 cases respectfully:
#     - JWT_SECRET: when using JWT tokens for authentication
#     - COOKIE_SECRET: when using signed cookies
#
# Use npm run generate:key to generate a key. Generate a new key for each of these values.
#
# In the case that you don't need signed cookies remove the cookie-parser package
# and the code that uses it, namely the import and `app.use(cookieParser(
#   config.getOrThrow('COOKIE_SECRET')
# ))` from the main.ts
#
# In case you want to setup up JWT authetication, checkout the NestJS documentation on
# authentication, they have a great and simple guide that shows how to set it up.
